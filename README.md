# Deep Learning Fundamentals with Keras.

This repo will introduce you to the field of deep learning and teach you the fundamentals. You will learn about some of the exciting applications of deep learning, the basics fo neural networks, different deep learning models, and how to build your first deep learning model using the easy yet powerful library Keras.

This repo will presentsimplified explanations to some oftoday's hottest topics in data science, including:

      What is deep learning?
      How do neural networks learn and what are activation functions?
      What are deep learning libraries and how do they compare to one another?
      What are supervised and unsupervised deep learning models?
      How to use Keras to build, train, and test deep learning models?
